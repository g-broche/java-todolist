## Context

Learning the very basics of Java through an Open Classrooms course.

The last part of the course involves making a basic todo list (the usual), for which i decided to make a separate repo.
Since it is just a training course on the basics of java, there won't be a dedicated user interface and actions will be performed through a command line interface.

I fully expect the project will go farther than what is shown during the related course as i will do my own experimentation to get a feel for how the language works before moving on to other projects.

## Project stop

As expected the project went deeper than what was covered in the initial course.
Implemented management of todo lists through command lines by using user input for command and argument parsing.
Also added commands to save existing todo lists into an xml file and loading of previously saved todo lists.

For now the project is stopped as this was only intended to learn the basics of Java and see some of the differences compared to languages i've previously worked with (PHP / JS) before moving on bigger java project and java framework (likely spring boot)
