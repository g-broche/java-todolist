## Context

Learning the very basics of Java through a Open Classrooms course.

The last part of the course involves making a basic todo list (the usual), for which i decided to make a separate repo.
Since it is just a training course on the basics of java, there won't be a dedicated user interface and actions will be performed through a command line interface.

I fully expect the project will go farther than what is shown during the related course as i will do my own experimentation to get a feel for how the language works before moving on to other projects.
